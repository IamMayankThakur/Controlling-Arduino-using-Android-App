# Controlling-Arduino-using-Android-App
This project enables the user to operate the arduino using a Android app, by the use of bluetooth. This project demonstrates a basic function of switching ON and OFF a LED, but the same concept can be extended to bigger projects.
This project was developed in Crucible of Research and Development(CoRI), PES University, Bangalore, in a Summer Internship program as a smaller part of another project.


## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. 
* Download the APK file from the project
* Install the APK file
* Upload the arduino code on the Arduino and make the required connections.
* Run the app, connect with the device by clicking on the Bluetooth Module of the Arduino in the list view.
* After, the connection has been established, Click on "ON" or "OFF"
* You can now send data to the arduino using bluetooth.

### Prerequisites

* This app has been developed on Android Studio and hence it is advisable to use **Android Studio**.
* An **Arduino IDE** is an essential requirement to upload the code onto the microcontroller

## Built With

* Android Studio - For the development of the Android App
* Arduino IDE - To work with the Microcontroller
